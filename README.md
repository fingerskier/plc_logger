# plc_logger
Logs PLC data


This tool requires
* [Node.js](www.nodejs.org): It is free and used widely in a variety of industries.
* [honcho](https://github.com/plcpeople/honcho): Also free, library for connecting to Profinet devices (S7, ABB, Mit, etc.).

Three files are required in addition to installing Node.js:
plc_logger.js | Do not edit this file!!!
log.cmd | The shell script.
log.json | Configuration settings - edit this file.
log.pts | List of points to be monitored.

NOTE: the three log.* files can be named anything, as long as the file-names begin the same.
	e.g. flarn.cmd, flarn.json, flarn.pts


The `*.cmd` file:
	You should only edit the 3rd line of this script:
`
	node plc_logger.js log > log_%mydate%_%mytime%.dat
`
	Change 'log' to whatever your project name is.  This name should match the three file-names (as stated above).


The `*.json` file:
	This is the main configuration.  Edit the values herein accordingly.

	Note that _honcho_ relies on other packages dependent on the type of controller:
		Siemens - [nodes7](https://github.com/plcpeople/nodeS7)
		Allen Bradley - [nodepccc](https://github.com/plcpeople/nodepccc)
		Mitsubishi - [mcprotocol](https://github.com/plcpeople/mcprotocol)


The `*.pts` file:

Examples of valid point addresses:
	```
	TEST1=M32.2		// Bit at M32.2
	TEST3=M20.0		// Bit at M20.0
	TEST4=DB1,REAL0.20		// Array of 20 values in DB1
	TEST5=DB1,REAL4		// Single real value
	TEST6=DB1,REAL8		// Another single real value
	TEST7=DB1,INT12.2
	```

	Every point address must have a corresponding entry in the mappings files.

	Examples of valid point mappings:
	```
	{
		"TEST1": { "tagsets":["status"] },
		"TEST3": { "tagsets":["status"] },
		"TEST4": { "tagsets":["status"] },
		"TEST5": { "tagsets":["status"] },
		"TEST6": { "tagsets":["status"] },
		"TEST7": { "tagsets":["status"] }
	}
	```


Multiple Logs:
	This project does not implement the 'tagset' feature.  To get logs of different groups of tags simply create copies of the three files, edit them accordingly, and run in a separate process.
